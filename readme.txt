Last working environment configuration 24 May 2016
OSX Version 10.11.4
Xcode Version 7.3 (7D175)

To open the project correctly, open "Where U At.xcworkspace" and not the
Xcode project. The workspace will be opened in Xcode. The simulator should run
alright, but there might be an issue with getting the application on a physical
device because heyitsjeoff@gmail.com is the developer email being used. I can't
test to confirm this on another Mac because I don't have access to one with
Xcode.
